Dear customer,

The current applied shader in all objects, which need transparency, is unlit alpha. You can easily see find it at Buil-in Shader List, right under Specular. It is used to not be affected by light.

In case you want the object interact on light, please change to Shaders/DoubleSided-Light-Spec.

If you have any question, please contact me at souchenki@gmail.com

Thank for paying attention to this pack
